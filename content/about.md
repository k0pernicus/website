### Work experience

##### R&D Engineer, **[DataThings](https://datathings.com/)**, _2021 > ..._  
I am developing, for production, deep learning algorithms to solve problems.  
I am working with different companies around the world in order to help them to fix their problems, and 
deploy the projects in clients code base / cloud stack.

##### Machine Learning Engineer & Software Engineer, **[Tadaweb](https://tadaweb.com/)**, _2018 > 2021_  
I helped to develop solutions for the Machine Learning team (Vision and NLP projects), and I conducted researches
for Vision projects, using `PyTorch` and `FastAI`.
In the same time, I helped the production team to build, test, and deploy microservices in k8s clusters.

##### Data Scientist & Software Developer, **[Dernier Cri](https://derniercri.io)**, _2016 > 2018_
I conducted R&D activities for startups and big companies (machine learning and big data), and applied research theories,
 principles, and practical models to solve R&D problems on numerical and textual data.  
I worked in parallel also on `Django` and `React-Native` projects for startups and big companies, and pushed in 
production my own projects.

##### R&D Engineer, **[UQÀM (LATECE team)](https://latece.uqam.ca/)**, Montréal (Canada) - _2016_
I developed tools and made several software experiments to build a strong open protocol to measure 
the energy consumption of Android devices and evaluate code smells impact on them.
