## Hi!

I am <em>Antonin Carette</em>, <em>machine learning engineer</em>.

I am interested in many fields of Computer Science like:

* <em>artificial intelligence</em> (machine learning & multi-agents systems),
* <em>video games engines</em>,
* <em>operating systems</em>.

Currently, my main programming languages are:

* <em>[Python](https://www.python.org)</em> (to design my prototypes, and to deal easily with DS/ML problems),  
* <em>[Rust](https://rust-lang.org)</em> (to develop my ready-to-push-in-production builds),
* <em>[Go](https://golang.org)</em> (easy to use, easy to develop with, between Python and Rust to develop with).

You can find my resume [in English](/CARETTE_EN_cv.pdf).  
Also, you can contact me at _antonin[at]carette[dot]xyz_ [PGP public key](/antonin@carette.xyz.asc).
