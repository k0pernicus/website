I'm a programmer.
I use in daily life four main programming languages: _Python_, _Rust_, _Golang_ and _Ocaml_, and I'm very happy to use my Macbook to develop softwares everyday.
As text editor, I use _NeoVim_ everyday, and I hate programming languages with dedicated GUIs (like Pharo for example).  
As daily softwares, I use a lot _Docker_, _Opera_, _Keybase_, _AirMail_, _Dropbox_ and _Flux_.

I use _The Evil_ (little tribute to trolls...) everyday: a beautiful early-2013 Macbook Air, 8Gbytes of RAM, 128Gbytes SSD and a dual core to code almost and surf the web 11 hours a day.  
And, you know what? I. LOVE. IT.

Sometimes, people (mostly trolls) are screwing on me to use macOS instead of a GNU/Linux distribution, or just want to troll with this kind of thinking:
>	C'mon on dude, you're a fucking programmer, you use bearded programs everyday...
>	Why you're not on a GNU/Linux computer, eh!?
>	Shame on you, loser...

In fact, I used many GNU/Linux computers before.
A lot of times, in many computers (laptops and PC).
But, now, I can't back to a GNU/Linux distribution.  
Before using the awesome machine, I was using for 10 years the following GNU/Linux distributions: Kubuntu (1 year - my first distribution), Debian (3 years), ArchLinux (5 years) and ElementaryOS (1 year).  
I think the evolution of those distributions shows that I was really fed-up using the console everyday to do simple stuff on ArchLinux, and I think that ElementaryOS is the best choice to use a GNU/Linux distribution with the friendliness of macOS.

Based on those 4 GNU/Linux distributions, I can formulate 4 reasons that I can't switch back to GNU/Linux.

*	A GNU/Linux distribution is not as simple as macOS (even ElementaryOS),
*	updates can kill easily your distribution (trust me, and it's really complicated to reinstall an OS 2 days before your final exam...),
*	the hardware support on Linux can be poor according to the distribution,
*	the community is great, but not as great than the macOS community, according to the choosen distribution,
*	the common use to work with macOS softwares, and the material (especially the battery life of Macbooks).

So yeah, I choose to use macOS in daily life and program on it, and it's not a big deal - even Linus Torvalds, the leader and principal developer of the Linux kernel uses a Macbook air everyday!  
I have no problems using some usefull softwares, and the OS is great (I didn't reboot my machine since maybe 2 weeks now...).
Alos, I'm not an Apple fanboy.
Really.
But I just don't want to buy some expensive ultrabooks by Lenovo (like the Carbon X1) or Asus just to use 80% of the hardware correctly.
