title: "One year after, I stopped my PhD"
---

One year ago, I wrote a simple blog post: [I quit my job to start a PhD](/2017/04/23/i_quit_for_a_phd/), and I explained in this blog post that I quitted my job at <em>[DernierCri](https://derniercri.io)</em> for a <em>PhD in Luxembourg</em> on <em>Automated Document Processing</em>.  
I was really excited about this new adventure, especially because I really wanted to be an expert in the (large) domain of Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing, since my Bachelor Degree.

Today, I am really disappointed about my research *and* research, and I just stopped my PhD to go back at <em>DernierCri</em>.

One year ago, I imagined my PhD as a vast field of experimentation with the following objectives: <em>learn</em>, <em>experiment</em>, <em>fail</em>, <em>succeed</em>, <em>start over</em>.  
_Spoiler_: It was not 100% the case.

One year ago, I imagined my PhD as a giant sandbox where you can experiment and discuss with guru to finally find a/some solution(s) to the problem you are solving, and publish it/them.  
_Spoiler_: It was definitly not the case.

I did not want to create a blog post about my bad experience only.  
Actually, if you have the possibility to do a PhD: go for it!
I strongly encourage you to pursue this noble quest.

*But*, please, do not make the same mistakes I did.
So, just to avoid them, I have attached some tips below.

## Do not accept a random subject

As I told you before, I really wanted to be an expert in ML/NLP, and I just wanted to do _something_ related to ML/NLP.  
This is the first (and maybe the biggest) mistake I made during this PhD: just accept a subject because it's related to the subfield I wanted to work on.  

## Abstract your work

My three-years PhD was in collaboration with a (big) external company, which has a clear and defined objective, and this has clearly an impact in your researches.  
So, ok, there are good things in working on a research project with a company, like: you have the data and the physical resources to train and deploy your learning model; and I really think that Universities have to create a link with companies if they still want to innovate.  
*But*, a company has an other objective than the research field: they want _something_ to test and to push in production, with competitive results (first meeting with the company was like: "We want at least 99% of good prediction, for this complex task. Good luck, you have three months").  
With those kinds of objectives, you have to define a plan.
And, taking into account the setbacks, you realize after six months you did not work at all on your research project, and that the work you've done for the company is well define for the company but not at all to use it in a research project.  
That's when you realize in the end that you're not a PhD student, but a software developer with more constraints...

## Check the research team expertise

The research team I worked with was really great, but it was really strange I was the only guy working on ML/NLP for documents processing.  
Other PhDs and Post-Docs have various subjects about computer security, and used basic or advanced ML models for software engineering projects, not dedicated subject like mine.  
Also, I found sometimes that it was difficult to discuss with them about their research.
As a personal though, since the subjects are very competitive at the moment, I think my colleagues were not inclined to share to have a chance to join the podium...  
So yep, I was alone, with the promess that a Post-Doc will be hired _asap_.
One year after, no Post-Doc on the project, and a few people to have high-level discussion about ML, not about NLP.
From that moment on, loneliness ultimately wins over your motivation.

## Check if your thesis supervisors are available...

... at least once a week to discuss your research with them.  
In my memories, I think I've had less than 6 meetings with them in the space of a year - which is incredibly little.  
I don't blame my supervisors, because I know that they themselves are under pressure to set up projects and publish non-stop for their own academic careers.
However, it is better to go in an environment that is more likely to help you than the other way around.

## Other researchers might don't care about you and your work, they care only about your publications

You are not evaluated by your code, your project, the publication of an innovative technical project, ...
Nop.
Nothing.

Your "rank" is computed using the papers you wrote and published (and where you published).

Also, as I've seen everywhere else, do not be surprised to find people you don't know as co-authors on your paper - they are just short of papers for their annual evaluation...

## It's not because it's a hard problem that is necessarily a research problem...

... and make some research before (like a day to crawl and to read papers on [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com) for example) to know if people did not already solve the problem!

## Be brave

Maybe I wasn't brave enough to support the pressure of both University and the company.
But, today, I am feeling very good - physically and mentally.
