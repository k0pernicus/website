Happy new year !

I hope that 2016 has been great for you.
For me, 2016 was mixed: good (my internship at Montreal, my graduation and a pretty cool job) and bad times (many assassination attempts and, obviously, the election of Trump).

This year, we increment (again) the counter, and pass from 2016 to 2017, and 
I hope that this new year will be full of **love**, **tolerance** and **respect**.

In this blog post, I show you my personal resolutions for 2017.
Because, as you know, a new year comes new resolutions !

## A healthy spirit in a healthy body

This year, I have to loose weight!  
A **lot** of weight!  
And, to loose weight, I have to exercise myself, eat healthier, and respect my sleep cycle.  
I wish to continue fencing, or to put on my rollerblades to discover new areas of my city... but I am lazy! :-(  

To practice a sport and eat two burgers per day at lunch is (really) not a good method to loose weights (unfortunately...).  
So, with my girlfriend, we have pledged that 2017 is the year of some healthier diners !  

_Come on Antonin, five fruits and five vegetables per day... You can do it !_

## Read, read, and read again...

I love rea but, unfortunately, I didn't read as much as I wanted to in 2016.  
This year, my second resolution is to read **MORE**: a book (fiction, biography, ...) every two weeks, and a 
research article per week (because to keep me informed about computer science researchs is important for me, and 
because I miss computer science research) in machine learning, compilers and operating systems domains.

## One big free/open source contribution this year

During the last month, I realized that I am not particularly good at begin and maintain a program.  
So, instead of developing something, I will contribute to a big free and/or open source project.

For this, my choice was to contribute to [Redox-OS](https://github.com/redox-os), a Rust operating system.
The community is really great, the project is important and big, and it is written in Rust!  
Just perfect :-)

## Mastering three "new" programming languages

My main programming language is [Python](https://www.python.org/). I spent virtually four years to be really good using this programming language and,
in all modesty, I'm pretty good using Python.  
But Python seems boring now, and I want to create and contribute to projects using typed and compiled programming languages.

So, for me, this year will be the year to perform myself in :
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org),
* [Ocaml](https://ocaml.org/),
* and [Nim](http://nim-lang.org/).

The goal to me for the end of this year is to acquire automatic reflexes for each of those programming languages, and 
maybe contribute of (at least) one big free and/or open source project for each one. 

## Back to GNU/Linux

Yes, I was wrong. macOS is cool but I miss a good operating system to contribute on strong projects (like Redox-OS).
Also, I think that 2017 will be the year to free myself about some "big brother" companies like Google, Apple, Dropbox or whatever...  
So, begin with a free operating system sounds a good investment ;-)
