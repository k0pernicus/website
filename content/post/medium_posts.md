I wrote a few articles for DernierCri about Big Data and Software Development [on Medium](https://blog.derniercri.io/@k0pernicus).  
If you are French (because the articles are written in French), do not hesitate to read them ;)

For your information, I will not use Medium anymore to write blog posts.

Also, I will work on blog post translation for those.
