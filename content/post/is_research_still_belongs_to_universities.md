I started my PhD two months ago, on automated ways to classify documents, and I begin to be depressed...

Since I started University in Computer Science, I wanted to do a PhD in biocomputing, combinatorial optimization, or machine learning.
For me, research activities conduct to new innovative techniques, or tools, which have to be tested on real world examples.

In CS class, Machine learning was the area I enjoyed the most - so it was natural to look for a PhD in ML.

Now, as a good PhD student, I started my start-of-the-art and I began to experiment two or three ideas.
So, I read about 50 or 60 research articles about new ways to classify documents, and text understanding.

The research articles I read in the area of machine learning came, in large majority, from web giants: Google, Facebook, Amazon, Baidu, Criteo... and other companies or startups which are related to those giants.
Also, at NIPS (one of the greatest conference about machine learning and computational neuroscience), companies are earning the majority of accepted papers.  
After reading those papers, I am wondering if innovative things in this research area still belong to Universities...

You may wondering why those companies are first in this area.

This is my answer:

1. They have a massive dataset of real world examples,
2. They have tech' (for example, the last chip from Google for DL, which is just amazing),
3. They own, or the work with, the best research scientists in AI (Y. LeCun, A. Ng, Hugo Larochelle,...),
4. They have the best engineers who are working hard on this subject,
5. They can test their idea directly on well designed products, faster than light.

I realized, during my previous internships, that there is a hard competition between research institutions and companies.
Some research institutions, like inria, share the idea that a research idea can be part of a great product - so, they propose to scientists to share ideas with startups, or to create their own startup.    
It's the same thing in University of Luxembourg - for example, the DataThings startup has been funded thanks to the research ideas of a great team of scientists who are working on real time data series.

Research institutions are moving from pure research to applied research, and it's great !  
But, is this change not too late ?  
Is AI research area already belongs to giants ?

I know that companies, especially today with DL, would not have done these wonderful tools/products without research scientists.
But I find unfortunate that those research scientists are now owned by private companies, to conduct internal research...

I am **really** scared that my work and research ideas are became soon *outdated*, because of a technology that exists since years but has not been released yet.
Also, how to add value to my PhD if you know that companies can explore, implement a solution and draft a paper about it faster than you ?

Actually, **I am** depressed...
