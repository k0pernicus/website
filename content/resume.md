## **Work experience**

### Machine Learning Engineer and Software Engineer  
#### **[Tadaweb](https://tadaweb.com/)**, Luxembourg - _November 2018 > Now_  
Help to develop tools and solutions for the Machine Learning team (Vision and NLP projects), conducts researches
for Vision projects using `PyTorch` and `FastAI`, and help production team to build, test, and deploy 
microservices (written in `Go`) in the cloud (`Docker`, `k8s`).  
Write production-level code (`Python`, `C`, `Go`) to integrate ML projects in Tadaweb’s core code and existing architecture.

### Data Scientist & Software Developer  
#### **[Dernier Cri](https://derniercri.io)**, Lille (France) - _April 2018 > November 2018_
Conducted R&D activities for startups and big companies (machine learning and big data), and applied research theories,
 principles, and practical models to solve R&D problems on numerical and textual data (using `Python` and many other 
 libraries like `scikit-lean`, `statsmodel` or `pandas`).  
Worked in parallel also on `Django` and `React-Native` projects for startups and big companies, and pushed in 
production my own projects.

### Assistant Professor
#### **[University of Luxembourg](https://wwwen.uni.lu/)**, Luxembourg - _September 2017 > December 2017_
Teached SQL, NoSQL, probabilties/statistics and machine learning to Bachelor students.

### Research and Development Engineer  
#### **[Dernier Cri](https://derniercri.io)**, Lille (France) - _October 2017 > April 2017_
Conducted R&D activities for startups and big companies (machine learning and big data), and applied research theories,
 principles, and practical models to solve R&D problems on numerical data only (using `Python` and many other 
 libraries like `scikit-lean`, `statsmodel` or `pandas`).

### Research and Development Engineer  
#### **[UQÀM (LATECE team)](https://latece.uqam.ca/)**, Montréal (Canada) - _March 2016 > August 2016_
Developed tools and made several software experiments to build a strong open protocol to measure 
the energy consumption of Android devices and evaluate code smells impact on them.  
_First author of a research paper, submitted and accepted to **SANER 2017**_
