## Hardware

* Macbook Air (M2) - 16GB of RAM, 256GB,
* Chromebook Lenovo Duet 3 (Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c)- 8GB of RAM, 128GB,
* Google Pixel 8,
* Nintendo Switch OLED

(Yes, **full ARM**!)

The chromebook is a pretty good device, which handles most of my usage at home.  
Also, it was really cheap.

I use this device principally because:
1. it is fast to boot, fast to shutdown,
2. [it is secure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9WVmNfgjtQ),
3. it is a very simple Linux machine, which **just works**.

However the CPU is not fast... this is why I keep my macbook under the hood 
when I need more power.

## Software

* Google Chrome & Google products,
* Visual Studio Code & Vim,
* Gmail & k-9 Mail on Android,
* [Hugo](https://www.gohugo.io) for my blog.

## Programming environment

* Expertise in C/C++, Go, Python, Rust ...
* and notions in Swift,
* Numpy, Scikit-Lean, XGBoost, and PyTorch for AI/ML (Tinygrad soon for DL?),
* Docker and LXC for containers,
* OpenGL, Vulkan and Metal for graphics APIs.
