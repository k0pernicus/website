I just discovered a very good dotfiles that contains a lot of hidden features in macOS, or to manage you system through the console.  
Please check it out [here](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.macos) if you are interested in.
Thanks to [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens) for this!
