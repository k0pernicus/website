Hey,  
if you did not know I am on Instagram since a few months now, posting some shots I take during day and night when I feel confident.

Talking about my gear, I used:
* an iPhone Xr, which was replaced by an iPhone 12 mini recently,
* a Canon EOS 100D with two different lenses: a 24mm and a 50mm - as the DLSR is APS-C the lenses correspond to a 35mm and 75mm with a full frame.

To edit the pictures I use [Darkroom](https://darkroom.co), on macOS.

Do not hesitate to take a look a few times a month, as I am going out more and more recently to take pictures outside.
