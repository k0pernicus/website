In my last year's blog post I wrote

> 2022 was a strange year for everyone I think.

I do think, as game developers (or just computer developers), we can agree that 2023 was way worst than 2022, 
maybe one of the worst year since a long time actually.  
Despite records sales in the video game industry, and record earnings, the number of layoffs in the field [was incredibly high](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/over-6000-games-industry-jobs-lost-in-2023-so-far) 
(more than 6000 jobs lost in 2023 only so far, recorded from January to November 2023).
Also, E3 communicated a few weeks ago they are definitely closing their doors, sounding the death knell of an era of 
physical celebration for the video game industry.  
I am very sad for all developers who lost their jobs this year, and I sincerely hope that the industry will recover 
quickly from this.

Professionnally I ported two video games for 5 platforms each, one game engine (and another half for 2024), and I 
helped porting two game engines to fix bugs in upcoming and released games.
Not so bad!
The main challenge of this year was porting _**SHINORUBI**_ and its game engine called [`V3X`](https://v3x.net), 
developed by [`RealtechVR`](https://www.realtech-vr.com/home/) for five different platforms: PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch, 
Xbox One and Xbox Series consoles.
The work for _SHINORUBI_ began in September 2022, ended in late-November 2023, and the release is planned for January 2024.
Apart from that I helped to make fixes for existing game engines but the games have not been annunced yet by RedArtGames 
so I can't tell anything the games and game engines (yet).

I continued my own game engine in my spare time, but more and more I tend refocusing the game engine to a 
renderer-only project, with a `Vulkan` and `Metal` backends.  
Also, I just finished the 2023 edition of **advent of code**, an annual program (in December) of small programming puzzles 
to solve "for fun".
As always I did not participate to the competition, mainly because I had to get up at 6AM to get a chance to participate 
(too early for me), but also because I wanted to do AoC for fun and without any stress.
Except the Day 24 Part 2 I did everything the release day, using `Swift`.
This year I put on my list `Rust`, `C++` or `Swift`, and asked to a friend to choose a number between 1 and 3 (included) - he 
choosed `3`... so `Swift` :)  
My AoC repository is available [here](https://github.com/k0pernicus/aoc2023).

I did not changed my computing environment: a **M2 macbook air** only, which I use for everything except gaming.
This machine is pretty incredible: great power & excellent battery life, perfect combo!

I played a very high number of good games this year:
* **Psychonauts 2**,
* **HiFi-Rush**,
* **Battlefield 4** (yes, I know, this one is old...),
* **Alan Wake 2** (my GOTY),
* **Quake 2 Remastered**,
* **Assassin's Creed: Mirage**,
* ...

I do not expect anything from 2024 except stablization in the game & software development industry: let's keep it simple.

Time for me to close the lid, wish you the best for 2024!
