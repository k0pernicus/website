Happy new year !

I hope that 2016 has been great for you.
For me, 2016 was mixed: good (my internship at Montreal, my graduation and a pretty cool job) and bad times (many assassination attempts and, obviously, the election of Trump).

This year, we increment (again) the counter, and pass from 2016 to 2017, and
I hope that this new year will be full of **love**, **tolerance** and **respect**.

In this blog post, I show you my personal resolutions for 2017.
Because, as you know, a new year comes new resolutions !

## A healthy spirit in a healthy body

This year, I have to loose weight!
A **lot** of weight!
And, to loose weight, I have to exercise myself, eat healthier, and respect my sleep cycle.
I wish to continue fencing, or to put on my rollerblades to discover new areas of my city... but I am lazy! :-(

To practice a sport and eat two burgers per day at lunch is (really) not a good method to loose weights (unfortunately...).
So, with my girlfriend, we have pledged that 2017 is the year of some healthier diners !

_Come on Antonin, five fruits and five vegetables per day... You can do it !_

## Read, read, and read again...

I love rea but, unfortunately, I didn't read as much as I wanted to in 2016.
This year, my second resolution is to read **MORE**: a book (fiction, biography, ...) every two weeks, and a
research article per week (because to keep me informed about computer science researchs is important for me, and
because I miss computer science research) in machine learning, compilers and operating systems domains.

## One big free/open source contribution this year

During the last month, I realized that I am not particularly good to begin and maintain a computer projects.
So, instead of developing something, I want to contribute to a big free and/or open source project.
My choice is to contribute mainly to [Redox-OS](https://github.com/redox-os), a Rust operating system.
The community is great, the project is big, awesome and important, and Redox is written with Rust!
Just the perfect project to involve myself in :-)

## Mastering three "new" programming languages

My main programming language is [Python](https://www.python.org/). I spent virtually four years to be really good using this programming language and,
in all modesty, I'm pretty good using Python.
But Python is boring now, and I want to create and contribute to projects using typed and compiled programming languages.
So, for me, I will perform myself with :

* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org),
* [Ocaml](https://ocaml.org/),
* and [Nim](http://nim-lang.org/).

The goal, for me, is to acquire some automatic reflexes for each of those programming languages, and to contribute to one big
free and/or open source project (for each one).

## Back to GNU/Linux

Yes, I was wrong...
macOS is cool but I miss a good operating system to contribute in strong computer projects like Redox-OS.
Also, I think that 2017 will be the year to free myself about some "big brother" companies like Google, Apple, Dropbox or whatever...
So, to begin the year with a free operating system (Arch Linux I think) sounds a good investment ;-)
