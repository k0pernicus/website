## Warning

This post contains very toxic and negative thoughts about software and "the Industry" in general...

## Content

Last week, I was "congratuled" **for having done shit**: making a project with a few human resources, a very very very short deadline, no tests *at all* (because **testing is failing** "lol"), and a few extra hours to spend in weekends and public holidays to "make it done".  
The project does not run well, developers and project managers are all burned out... and this is what the company called "a success".

**This** made me very sad, and I asked myself since, after several more or less good experiences as a computer developer, if I still had a future in this industry.

Web development, which was a wonderful idea decades ago with a simple idea: unifying all platforms into one piece of code that can be run everywhere *if* you have a browser, is now a big pile of shitty libraries and weird pieces of code, that do nothing else than throwing powerful resources (hardware and humans) in trash, nothing more.  
And this costs to the client thousands of euros...  
This is making me sick, and frustrates me **a lot**.

I am frustrated about everything involving computer development those days, and I think I began to scratch the surface of what is a "developer" in 2022: someone who don't know how to code but do it anyway because:
1. there is money in the table,
2. you can earn a shit ton of money if you are fast (which is totally different than beeing good at it),
3. it's hype.

#### Note

I am making a difference between "being a programmer", and "being a developer":
* the programmer optimizes things and can **create** very great piece of software well, that can be reusable (or not) if he desires it,  
* the developer will uses those resources to **build** something with those, and maybe combinating those little pieces to create a good software architecture and, at the end of the process, a product.  
I was considering myself as a programmer, but looking for other programmers, how they work and how they build incredible pieces of software from scratch, I am **just** a developer with "programmer skills" experience(s).

This is difficult sometimes to discuss with a "3-months experienced Ruby developer" that contradicts you on real facts (how a computer runs and why his code is slow... and may crash randomly), and to listen him explaining why he will not optimize his code as "servers with 8 gigabytes of RAM is cheap now. And the entire project does not runs the fans of my macbook so... Dah.".

#### Second note 

For those who are interested about "collapse of programmers knowledge", there is an interesting talk from Jonathan Blow about that, which resumes itself the current situation in the Industry.

I don't remember also seeing the desastrous impact of companies everywhere now, which want to do "something fast, with less resources, and spending the less money as possible".
And this leads to **many** issues to the hands / shoulders of developers, just because "_spending money in a company is not the purpose of a company_".  
Today is about NFTs, web3, and how to fuck up Earth for big useless computational resources.

**WHAT. THE. FUCK.**

What is the purpose of making big plans for several years if we have to stop everything in a few years as we just fucked up the Planet?

I don't remember the days I was happy to open the lide of my computer and doing open-source for "nothing" (except spending my time)... Actually, I remember some of those now, creating stuff for the [redox-OS project](https://www.redox-os.org/), and it was a long time ago.  
But looking at it now, I don't understand why I spent so much time on this.

I am burned out, and we are only in February 2022... Oh god.
