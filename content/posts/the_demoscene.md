Among all the computer subcultures that exist, the demoscene subculture is, without a doubt, the one that impresses me 
the most.  
The demoscene is composed by demomakers, a worldwide network of very creative minds involved in the making of 
(non-commercial) **demos**, just for fun.

But was is a _demo_?
A demo is a technical and/or aesthetic achievement made by demomakers - most of the time by groups of demomakers -, to show off their programming, visual and musical skills through an innovative computer program.  
There are many demoscene productions: games, graphics, music, ... all with an idea of solving a challenge, 
making a new big technical achievement, innovating, while having a lot fun.

There exists a nice file browser in [scene.org](https://www.scene.org) for 2022, [here](https://files.scene.org/browse/parties/2022/), that you can browse to look for great and fun achievements, with the only goal of making something 
"great and fun".

As an example, this is a _demo_ of a low-fidelity modern cinematic on an Amiga 500, a 34 years old computer, called 
"Eon" by _The Black Lotus_: {{<youtube id="i1O4_58HVIg" autoplay="false">}}

The Amiga 500 was the most popular computer of the Amiga family, composed by a Motorola 68000 CPU (7,09 MHz PAL, or 7,14MHz NTSC), and 512 KBytes of RAM, which is **16384 times less** RAM than actual modern computers.
In the 80s, the Amiga offered a beautiful and colorful display, a better sound and a more advanced operating system than
most of its competitors **as standard**.  
The Amiga 500 for the demoscene is not an exception: the demomaking computers family that were commonly used 
were: the Commodore 64, the Atari ST and, of course, the Amiga family.

Composed generally between 3 and 8 people, demomakers masterize their tools, and have so much creative minds to push the boundaries of programming, graphics, and music composition.

Another demo from _The Black Lotus_ shows, in **2006**, a very impressive demo called "Starstruck" running on an 
(accelerated) Amiga 1200, competing with the best games of the time on recent hardware:

The demoscene contains multiple contests itself.
The most known are:
* the **4k** contests: the demo must be self-contained in an executable of 4KBytes,
* the **64k** contests (or **intros**): the demo must be self-contained in an executable of 64KBytes,
* the **Demo** contests: people express their creativity in building small executables (generally 4MBytes) with great graphics,
* the **Gfx** contests: graphics contests,
* and the **Mod** contests: for musicians, to express their creativity creating partitions based on new unique sounds.

About video games, a lot of newly created studios come from demoscenes like [Starbreeze](https://www.starbreeze.com), 
[Remedy](https://www.remedygames.com), [Techland](https://techland.net), 
[Guerilla Games](https://www.guerrilla-games.com), or [Housemarque](http://www.housemarque.com).
